      <li>Step 4: Once the mixture has cooled down, cover it tightly and chill it in the refrigerator for one hour.</li>
      <li>Step 5: Mix the cream and vanilla in a bowl. Mix until you start to see stiff peeks in the mixture start to form.</li>
      <li>Step 6: Pull the mixture from the fridge and add the mascarpone cheese. Whisk the cheese in until the mixture is smooth.</li>

      <li>Step 8: Place half of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch casserole dish.</li>
      <li>Step 9: Spread half of the mixture with the mascarone over the lady fingers. Then apply half of the whipped cream over that. Lay the remaining ladyfingers down and repeat the process.</li>
