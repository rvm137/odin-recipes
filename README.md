The Odin Recipe Project

Created a main page with three links to different recipes. Both the pictures and text link to the corresponding page.

- Tres Leches Cake
    - Has a title, picture, description, ingredients list, and steps to make the recipe.
- Tiramisu
    - Has a title, picture, description, ingredients list, and steps to make the recipe.
- Fluffy Japanese Pancakes
    - Has a title, picture, description, ingredients list, and steps to make the recipe.

Minimal styling has been done through css as this is on of my first projects. Added some light background color to the pages and headers. 

Linked the sub-pages back the the main page. 

Basic first multi-page website project.
