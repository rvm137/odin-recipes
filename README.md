The Odin Recipe Project

Created a main page with three links to different recipes.

- Tres Leches Cake
- Tiramisu
- Fluffy Japanese Pancakes

Minimal styling has been done through css as this is on of my first projects. Linked the pictures to the recipes as well as through the text and found a way to add in a gif as well.

Basic first multi-page website project.
